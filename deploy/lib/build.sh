# SECURITY: deploy.sh itself runs as root, but everything in this file that
# executes repository-controlled code (npm ci / npm run build — which runs
# package.json lifecycle scripts and node_modules/.bin binaries — and
# scripts/bootstrap-admin.js) is executed via _as_build_user, which drops
# privileges to $APP_USER (elrenadtech) first. elrenadtech-ci (which owns
# this git working tree) can push arbitrary backend/frontend code, but the
# worst it can do is run code as the unprivileged elrenadtech service user —
# the exact same blast radius as the app's own runtime, never root. Root
# only touches the *output* of these steps (a plain chown, no code
# execution) after the fact.
#
# Both package.json files ship an npm package-lock.json (lockfileVersion 3),
# so `npm ci` is the correct deterministic install.
