#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ONE-TIME, run manually by root on the VPS (not part of deploy.sh, and
# never run by CI itself). Creates a dedicated, least-privilege system user
# that GitHub Actions uses to trigger deployments — instead of giving CI
# your root SSH key.
#
# The user can log in over SSH (key-only) and, via a narrow NOPASSWD sudoers
# rule, run ONLY a root-owned entrypoint (/usr/local/sbin/deploy-elrenadtech)
# as root — nothing else, and nothing it can itself modify.
#
# SECURITY NOTE: this user owns the git working tree at $PROJECT_DIR (it
# needs to git pull/checkout before triggering a deploy), which means it
# owns deploy/deploy.sh and deploy/lib/*.sh too. Sudo-whitelisting that
# CI-writable path directly would be equivalent to unrestricted root access
# (CI could rewrite deploy.sh, then sudo-execute its own code as root). To
# avoid that, this script instead copies the current deploy/ tree into a
# ROOT-OWNED location outside the repo (/usr/local/lib/elrenadtech-deploy)
# and points the sudoers rule at a root-owned wrapper
# (/usr/local/sbin/deploy-elrenadtech) that runs the frozen copy — never
# the repo's own copy.
#
# Consequence: changes to deploy/deploy.sh or deploy/lib/*.sh do NOT take
# effect for CI-triggered deploys until a human reviews them and re-runs
# this script as root, which re-syncs the frozen copy. This is deliberate —
# it's the actual privilege boundary between "CI can ship app code changes"
# and "CI can run arbitrary code as root".
#
# Usage (on the VPS, as root):
#   ./deploy/setup-ci-deploy-user.sh "ssh-ed25519 AAAA... github-actions"
#
# The argument is the PUBLIC key GitHub Actions will authenticate with (the
# matching private key goes into the VPS_SSH_KEY GitHub secret — never onto
# this server). Safe to re-run any time (e.g. after reviewing a deploy/
# script change) — every step here is idempotent.
