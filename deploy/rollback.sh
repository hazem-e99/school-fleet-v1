# Rolls elrenad.tech back to a previous commit and redeploys it. Since this
# deploy uses a simple in-place `git pull` model (matching el-renad.com's
# own proven deploy/), rollback is: reset the working tree to a known-good
# commit, then re-run the same deploy.sh that got that commit working the
# first time.
#
# el-renad.com's own repo/services/database are never touched by this.
# Database changes made by the failed release are NOT undone — this only
# rolls back code. For a database rollback see deploy/backup.sh's restore
# instructions.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./deploy/rollback.sh <commit-sha>
#   sudo ./deploy/rollback.sh          # rolls back to the previous commit (HEAD~1)
